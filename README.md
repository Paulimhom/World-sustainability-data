# World-sustainability-dataset analysis

This repository contains dataset (including my Jupyter notebooks and scripts) related to the project "CO2 emissions and percntage population below  poverty line analysis".

Analysis of World-sustainability-dataset and the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emmissions - Total Europe  dataset from quandl to identify pattern and trend using Python on jupyter notebook.

### Introduction
The world sustainability dataset is a global sustainabilityâ€™ dataset that has been put together from several merged data sources. The dataset tracks the performance of 173 countries against a range of sustainability metrics over a 19-year period. 

### Dataset
The data contains 54 columns and 3287 rows. After the Data Quality check, only two indicators were choosen from the dataset for analysis.	
The Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emmissions - Total Europe from quandl dataset contains data from 1965 to 2020 of all emmissions from the use of petroleum products.

### Objective
This analysis  takes a look at two keep metrics of countries and that have been taking steps to reduces their CO2 emissions over the last 19 years in order to identify patterns and relationships in the occurence over time.


### Key Questions explored

Which countries still has the least access to clean water and sanitization?

- Which continent has the least number of female enrollment in school?

- Which countries has the highest proportion of population below the international poverty line ($1.25), therefore are behind in SDG 1?

- Country with the highest unemployment rate  

- Which country has the lowest CO2 emissions 

- How does CO2 emission of a country relate to the percentage population been lifted from poverty?

- Which countries still has proportion of people below the poverty line ?
